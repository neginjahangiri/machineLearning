    <H1>Producing plans (Urban Layers) from aerial photo</H1>
    
    <H2>Description of work</H2>
    The idea of this work is to produce maps from satellite view or aerial photos. These days in the era of computers and digitalization urban planners and designers still invest a lot of their time producing these kinds of maps for their analyses. Considering efficiency of the machines, neural networks and Machine-learning could be a better alternative.
    
    <H2>Description of process</H2>
    Working with several paired images of Major cities in EU and USA in satellite- and Map view as training Dataset, which is gained from mapsRetriever (a tool to collect maps from Google Maps API) in <a href="https://github.com/neginjahangiri/mapsRetreiver">GitHub</a>.
    The styling of the maps has been prepared with the help of <a href="https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/">Google Maps Styling Wizard</a>, where we can personalize the colors and the style.

        <H2>Results</H2>
        These are the results of two trained neural networks:
